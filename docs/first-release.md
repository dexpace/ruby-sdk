# First Release

Release-readiness register. **Nothing has been published.** There is no `gems/` directory yet, no
tag, and no version beyond the `0.0.0` every gem will start at.

## Gems, once they exist

Per `docs/sdk-design-ruby/02-gem-and-workspace-layout.md` §2.1, the MVP is six gems, every one of
them at `0.0.0` until the first release:

| Gem | Published? |
|---|---|
| `dexpace-core` | no — 0.0.0 |
| `dexpace-transport-net_http` | no — 0.0.0 |
| `dexpace-serde-json` | no — 0.0.0 |
| `dexpace-transport-async_http` | no — 0.0.0 |
| `dexpace-async-thread` | no — 0.0.0 |
| `dexpace-conformance` | no — 0.0.0 |

## Blockers before first publish

- [ ] Repository scaffolding: `gems/`, root `Gemfile`, `Rakefile`, `Steepfile`,
      `rbs_collection.yaml`, `.rubocop.yml`, `VERSIONS` (§2.3)
- [ ] CI wired up and green on every gem
- [ ] The `dexpace-conformance` suite passing across the full supported Ruby range, 3.2 through 4.0
- [ ] An RBS sig-diff baseline established, so a later release can be checked against it for an
      accidental breaking change
- [ ] `SECURITY.md` contact confirmed reachable and monitored
- [ ] RubyGems ownership settled for every gem name above, and trusted publishing configured
      (OIDC-based, no long-lived API key committed anywhere)
- [ ] A decision on the four unbuilt convenience requirements in the HTTP domain model —
      `HTTP-48` (ETag), `HTTP-49` (HTTP range) and `HTTP-50` (the conditional-request aggregator),
      all SHOULD-level, plus `HTTP-22` (header-name interning, a MAY). Phase 1 built none of them
      and phase 6 is their target (`DEF-2`); this line exists so a release that ships before phase
      6 states that it ships without them rather than discovering it afterwards

## Release path

Not yet defined. `NFR-16`'s signing requirement is enforced on the release path only once that
path exists (see `docs/sdk-design-ruby/12-appendix-requirement-coverage-index.md`, NFR row); until
then there is no path to enforce it on.
