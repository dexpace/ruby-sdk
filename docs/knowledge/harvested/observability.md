# observability

## Rules
- When the requested log level is disabled, obtaining a log event and invoking its builder and terminal-emit methods must allocate nothing and produce no output, with enabled/disabled decided once at event-creation time via a shared inert event. (OBS-1)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:7-7` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- The structured-logging facade must expose exactly four severity levels—ERROR, WARNING, INFO, and VERBOSE—mapped onto the backend's ERROR, WARN, INFO, and most-verbose/DEBUG levels. (OBS-2)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:8-8` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- A log field key must be rejected when empty, and a null field value must not be dropped but must be emitted as the literal string "null". (OBS-3)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:9-9` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- Calling event(name) sets an authoritative categorisation tag under the reserved key "event", clears the tag when given an empty name, and suppresses any "event" key from global context, folded diagnostic context, or a per-event field so the emitted event carries "event" exactly once, because JSON appenders would otherwise produce invalid duplicate-key output. (OBS-4)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:10-10` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- When the same field key is contributed by more than one source, precedence must be per-event field over global context over folded diagnostic context, and a key must appear at most once in the emitted event. (OBS-5)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:11-11` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- Field-value rendering must be total and never throw, rendering throwables as "SimpleClassName: message", arrays/collections/maps as a bracketed textual form, and numeric/boolean/char primitives type-preserving, substituting a diagnostic placeholder if a value's own string conversion throws. (OBS-6)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:12-12` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- A rendered log field value should be truncated to a bounded maximum (reference default 8 KiB) with a truncation marker, exempting primitive values. (OBS-7)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:13-13` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- A single log event must be emitted at most once, with a second terminal emit becoming a no-op under a guard that is correct under concurrent invocation, though field/tag/cause accumulation need not itself be thread-safe. (OBS-8)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:14-14` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- A global key/value context configured on the logger must attach to every event subject to field-precedence rules, and for hot-path efficiency the implementation should reference the caller-supplied context rather than deep-copying it per event. (OBS-9, OBS-5)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:15-15` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- A once-per-logger diagnostic should warn, throttled to at most one emission per logger and gated on the verbose level being enabled, when a caller sets a per-event field colliding with the reserved "event" key, while ambient "event" keys from global or diagnostic context defer silently without being warned about. (OBS-40)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:16-16` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- When folding thread-local diagnostic context into a log event, only allow-listed keys are folded, the default allow-list is exactly {trace.id, span.id}, a null allow-list opts into folding every present key, and keys with null values are skipped, to prevent arbitrary application context from leaking into SDK-owned events. (OBS-10)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:20-20` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- Every log-emission site (request/response/failure events and the body-drain feeding them) must catch any exception and re-surface it as a best-effort http.instrumentation.* diagnostic, swallowing any secondary failure while emitting that diagnostic, so instrumentation logging never fails the request. (OBS-20, OBS-30)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:36-36` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- A Span must expose a recording flag, all mutators must be inert and end() a no-op when non-recording, and end() in both its success and error variants must be idempotent. (OBS-21)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:40-40` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- Activating a span as current must return a closeable scope handle that restores the previously-active span on close, usable from a try/using construct, and must restore even when the guarded code throws. (OBS-22)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:41-41` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- Activating a span for log correlation must push the trace id and span id onto the thread-local diagnostic context under keys trace.id and span.id for the scope's lifetime, restoring each to its prior value or removing it on close, while a non-recording span skips the push and delegates to plain current-span activation. (OBS-23)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:42-42` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- Thread-local diagnostic context must be bridgeable across async thread boundaries via an immutable snapshot, captured on the originating thread, reinstalled on the executing thread for a block's duration, and restored afterward including on exception. (OBS-24)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:43-43` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- Tracing abstractions must provide allocation-free no-op defaults for when tracing is disabled—a no-op tracer returning a shared no-op span, a no-op span with a cached current-scope, a no-op instrumentation context with all-invalid sentinels, and a no-op HTTP-tracer/factory—such that selecting a no-op path never allocates per call. (OBS-25)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:44-44` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- An instrumentation/trace context exposes W3C-compliant identifiers—a trace id, a 16-lowercase-hex-character span id, trace flags as a two-hex-character byte, and a trace-state list—plus validity and remoteness flags, with reserved invalid sentinels of a 32-hex-zero trace id, 16-hex-zero span id, "00" trace flags, and empty trace-state; an all-zero trace or span id is treated as invalid. (OBS-26)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:48-48` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- Trace-id generation must support at least a W3C flavour (128-bit as 32 lowercase hex), a Datadog flavour (64-bit unsigned decimal), and a no-op flavour yielding the invalid sentinel, and must never produce the reserved all-zero id, coercing a zero draw to non-zero. (OBS-27)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:49-49` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- The SDK should provide an HTTP-shaped tracer vocabulary richer than start/end, covering operation started/succeeded/failed, per-attempt started/failed-with-next-delay/retries-exhausted, and transport milestones (URL resolved, connection acquired, request sent with byte count, response headers received, response received with byte count), with every method defaulting to a no-op so adding an event is non-breaking. (OBS-28)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:53-53` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- HTTP-tracer lifecycle ordering requires operationStarted exactly once at the start, operationSucceeded and operationFailed to be mutually exclusive and each fire at most once at the end, attempt events to fire multiple times, and retries-exhausted, when it fires, to be immediately followed by operationFailed carrying the same throwable, with one tracer instance corresponding 1:1 to a single logical operation. (OBS-29)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:54-54` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- Tracer and HTTP-tracer callbacks, as well as metrics instruments, must be safe to invoke concurrently and from transport threads and must never throw, since the runtime does not defensively catch these callbacks and a violation breaks the caller's request. (OBS-30, OBS-20)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:55-55` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- The metrics SPI exposes a Meter that manufactures at least a monotonic integer counter and a floating-point histogram, each accepting per-measurement key/value attributes, with a default no-op Meter that discards every measurement, returns shared instrument singletons, and keeps the core free of any metrics runtime dependency. (OBS-31)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:59-59` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- Metric names, descriptions, and units should follow OpenTelemetry semantic conventions and UCUM unit symbols, with the default HTTP instrumentation emitting a request counter http.client.request.count (unit {request}) and a latency histogram http.client.request.duration (unit ms), tagged with method and either status code on success or error type on failure. (OBS-32)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:60-60` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- A monotonic counter documents that only non-negative increments are valid with negative deltas undefined and the caller's responsibility, and the core instrument must not validate on the hot path, while a histogram must tolerate any input including non-finite values without throwing, delegating handling of non-finite values to concrete adapters. (OBS-33)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:61-61` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- HTTP logging granularity is selectable across at least none, headers-only, and headers-plus-body, defaulting to none; at none, request/response log events are not emitted, while span lifecycle and metric recording still run on every request independent of the log level. (OBS-34)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:65-65` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- A log-level value should be resolvable from layered configuration (explicit override, then environment variable, then normalized system property, then default) with tolerant, case-insensitive, whitespace-trimmed parsing, falling back to a caller-supplied default that itself defaults to "none", and the SDK must not bake in a default config key name. (OBS-35)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:66-66` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- Under body logging, body capture is bounded to a configurable preview size (reference default 8 KiB) and must not buffer the whole body, so a body larger than the cap still streams in full to the caller by replaying the captured prefix then continuing from the live tail while only the preview occupies memory. (OBS-36)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:67-67` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- For unknown-length (streaming/chunked) response bodies, the async logging path should skip body capture entirely and stream the body unwrapped so a slow producer cannot block the completion thread. (OBS-37)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:68-68` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- A captured body preview should be charset-aware for text (decoding with the media type's charset, falling back to UTF-8) and binary-safe for non-text content via a size-only marker such as [binary N bytes captured]; decoding must never throw, and empty input yields an empty preview. (OBS-38)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:69-69` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- Emitted structured event names and field keys must be stable, at minimum including http.request and http.response events carrying http.request.method, redacted url.full, http.response.status_code, http.response.duration_ms, and content-length/header fields, with a failure additionally carrying error.type and the throwable cause, and url.full always being the redacted form. (OBS-39)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:70-70` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- Observability code paths (redaction, event emission, span/metric recording) MUST NEVER throw into the caller's request path; a failure to redact/render/emit MUST degrade gracefully via a safe placeholder or a self-describing instrumentation-error event and let the request proceed. (XCUT-20)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/19-cross-cutting-invariants-and-policies.md:48` · high · sha:d6123be82c9e</sub>
- Instrumentation callbacks must not throw and the runtime does not defensively catch them for tracer and meter calls, while every log-emission call site is wrapped and degrades to an http.instrumentation.* diagnostic on failure. (OBS-30, OBS-20, XCUT-20)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:14-17` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- Logger#event performs the enabled/disabled check exactly once, at that call, returning either a fresh live event or the frozen INERT singleton, so the singleton is reference-identical across every call. (OBS-1)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:36-39` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- An empty log field key raises an ArgumentError at #field, surfaced at the call site as the caller's bug rather than as a malformed line in a log aggregator, while a nil field value is not dropped but emitted as the literal null. (OBS-3)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:43-46` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- #event(name) sets the authoritative categorisation tag under the reserved key "event"; an empty name clears the tag rather than emitting event=, and when a non-empty tag is set, any event key arriving from global context, folded diagnostic context, or a per-event field is suppressed so the emitted record carries event exactly once. (OBS-4)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:47-51` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- Log field precedence is per-event field beats global context beats folded diagnostic context, with a key appearing at most once in the emitted record, implemented as a single merge in that order into one Hash at emit time rather than as three sources consulted independently by the renderer. (OBS-5)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:52-55` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- Log rendering is total: an exception renders as SimpleClassName colon message (using e.class.name with namespaces stripped), arrays/hashes/other collections render in a bracketed textual form, numerics/booleans/characters pass through type-preserving, and if a value's own #to_s raises, the facade substitutes a diagnostic placeholder rather than propagating. (OBS-6, OBS-7)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:56-63` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- A second terminal #emit call on the same log event instance is a no-op, guarded by a @emitted boolean flipped under a Thread::Mutex that is released before the sink call, so an emit that blocks on I/O does not hold a lock across a suspension point. (OBS-8)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:65-69` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- A global key/value context configured on the logger attaches to every event that logger produces, subject to standard field precedence, and the context is referenced rather than deep-copied per event, with the logger freezing the context at configuration time instead of trusting the caller to leave it alone. (OBS-9, OBS-5)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:71-75` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- url.full in emitted instrumentation events is always the redacted URL, because an unredacted url.full is how query-string credentials would reach a log aggregator. (OBS-11, OBS-19)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:79-81` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- If a caller sets a per-event field named "event" while a categorisation tag is already set, the field is dropped in favour of the tag and the logger warns once at verbose level, gated on verbose being enabled and throttled to one emission per logger; ambient event keys from global or diagnostic context defer silently without a warning. (OBS-40)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:84-88` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- Redaction totality is enforced by a rescue that returns the fixed sentinel "[malformed url]" and never raises. (OBS-13, OBS-15)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:147-148` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>

## Constraints
- Tracer callbacks (span start, scope activation, end) and metrics callbacks (counter/histogram) are not defensively wrapped by the runtime, so a throwing tracer or meter will propagate and can fail the request. (OBS-20, OBS-30)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:36-36` · high · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- Ruby cannot make an enabled structured log event allocation-free; only the disabled path is required to allocate nothing, and this is verified by an allocation-count test. (OBS-1)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:38-41` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- URL redaction runs on the way into #field rather than at the sink, so no sink implementation can bypass it. (OBS-11, OBS-19)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:81-82` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>

## Conclusions
- The observability design deliberately treats log-emission failures as always caught and swallowed while leaving tracer and metrics calls unwrapped, relying on the SPI contract that those callbacks never throw. (OBS-30)
  <sub>spec · `docs/product-spec/15-instrumentation-and-observability.md:3-3` · medium · sha:1b678eca176d</sub>
- A generic pub/sub bus shape with a single #call(event_name, payload) method was rejected for the instrumentation listener because a disabled level must allocate nothing, and a (name, payload) bus forces a Hash allocation at every call site whether or not anyone is listening. (OBS-1)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:5-8` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- A plain Logger-shaped sink (a sink.info { } call) was rejected as the shape for structured log events despite being the obviously idiomatic Ruby answer, because eight MUST requirements are stated about a stateful event object rather than about a logging call, and have nowhere to live on a sink call. (OBS-1)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:19-27` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- Core never requires the "logger" standard library because logger becomes a bundled (non-default) gem in Ruby 4.0, and requiring it from a zero-dependency core would create an undeclared dependency on a supported interpreter.
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:90-92` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- Log emission uses the block form (sink.debug { ... }) so no rendering runs if the sink's own level check disagrees, acting as a redundant guard for a sink whose level moved after event creation, separate from the enabled decision which is fixed at #event. (OBS-1, OBS-2)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:97-99` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- Two logging bridges were chosen to span the two poles of the Ruby ecosystem: SemanticLogger (structured, JSON-first) for operations-heavy shops, and the stdlib Logger for a small consumer's zero-configuration default, both reached through the same duck type with no adapter gem required.
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:102-108` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- Tracing is implemented as a structural subset of the Tracer/Span shape of the opentelemetry-api gem because Ruby's tracing ecosystem has converged there and that gem is explicitly designed to be safe for libraries to depend on, choosing one shape rather than the two poles chosen for logging because the tracing ecosystem itself has only one pole.

- Deferring the correlation bundle's shape until an OpenTelemetry adapter exists was rejected because it would mean every context type, the context promotion chain, and the call key would all change once the adapter lands; core instead ships Dexpace::Instrumentation::Bundle as a frozen Data with all nine members from the start.

- URL redaction leans on Ruby's URI class for userinfo and query but is hand-rolled for the fragment, because URI does not tokenise key=value pairs out of a fragment. (OBS-11, OBS-19, XCUT-19, OBS-13, OBS-15)

- The instrumentation listener is duck-typed on named methods such as #request_started(ctx), #attempt_failed(ctx, error, next_delay), and #connection_acquired(ctx), which pass arguments on the stack and allocate nothing when the installed listener is the frozen Dexpace::Instrumentation::NULL singleton. (OBS-28, OBS-29)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:8-11` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- The instrumentation lifecycle ordering requires exactly one operation_started event, a mutually exclusive single operation_succeeded or operation_failed event, repeating attempt events, and retries_exhausted immediately followed by operation_failed carrying the same error, with one listener per logical operation; this ordering is asserted by a dedicated test.

- A CallableAdapter wrapping a #call(name, payload)-style object is offered so the pub/sub bus shape is available to consumers without being the default listener interface. (OBS-30)

- The structured log event API is Dexpace::Instrumentation::Event, obtained from Logger#event(severity) and never constructed directly, with builder methods #field(key, value), #tag(key, value), #event(name), #cause(error), and #emit, plus a frozen shared singleton Dexpace::Instrumentation::Event::INERT returned when the severity is disabled.
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:30-33` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- Every builder method on a log Event returns self so calls compose into chains, and INERT is a frozen instance whose builder methods return self while its #emit does nothing.

- The rendering path rescues StandardError per value and substitutes "[unrenderable <ClassName>]" because BasicObject has no #to_s at all, a lazily-loaded proxy can raise from it, and #inspect on a partially initialised object raises routinely. (OBS-7)

- A lone boolean flag read and write is atomic on CRuby but not on JRuby or TruffleRuby, which is why the emit-once guard uses a mutex rather than relying on the GVL.

- The emitted HTTP instrumentation vocabulary is fixed: events named http.request and http.response carrying http.request.method, url.full, http.response.status_code, http.response.duration_ms, and content-length/header fields, with a failure emitting an http.response event carrying error.type and the exception attached as cause.

  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:76-79` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- The log output sink is defined as a duck type: anything responding to #debug/#info/#warn/#error plus the #debug?-style predicates, matching the stdlib Logger surface, so a stdlib Logger, a Rails logger, or SemanticLogger drops in with zero adapter code.
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:93-96` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- A frozen NullLogger whose predicates return false is the default sink, and it is the predicate that Logger#event consults to decide between a live event and INERT.

- The four instrumentation severities ERROR, WARNING, INFO, and VERBOSE map onto Logger's ERROR, WARN, INFO, and DEBUG respectively. (OBS-1, OBS-2)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:99-100` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- An application running no OpenTelemetry gets a frozen no-op tracer with a no-op span, cached scope, and all-invalid sentinels, while dexpace-instrumentation-otel is the one adapter permitted presence-gated activation to wire richer semantics. (OBS-25, OBS-31)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:114-117` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>

  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:117-118` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- Every context must carry a correlation/instrumentation metadata bundle exposing at minimum a trace id, a span id, trace flags, trace state, a trace-id encoding flavor, validity and remoteness flags, an active span, and a per-operation tracer factory. (CTX-14)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:120-123` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- The untraced correlation bundle defines every field explicitly: trace id of 32 hex zeros, span id of 16 hex zeros, trace flags 00, empty trace state, a no-op trace-id flavour, valid? equal to false, remote? equal to false, a shared no-op span, and a no-op per-operation tracer factory.

  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:127-130` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- One frozen Bundle::NONE singleton is shared across every untraced call, which is why the call key used elsewhere cannot be derived from the bundle and instead carries a monotonic counter. (CTX-15, CTX-4)
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:130-133` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- Diagnostic context uses Ruby fiber storage (Fiber[:key], available since 3.2) rather than Thread.current, since ASYNC-8 through ASYNC-12 require correlation context propagation.
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:136-137` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- Verified behaviour: Fiber[:key] is inherited by a child fiber, by a newly created Thread, and by an Enumerator's internal fiber, while Thread.current[:key] — despite its name — is fiber-local and visible in none of them.
  <sub>design · `docs/sdk-design-ruby/08-instrumentation-and-configuration.md:137-139` · high · sha:180a9abbb69f</sub>
- Fiber storage is not sufficient at pooled-worker reuse boundaries, so dexpace-async-thread saves a pooled worker's prior storage, installs a captured snapshot for the work's duration, and restores it in an ensure block, with the capture taken per task submission rather than at pool construction, and an absent context captured as empty and reinstated as a clear rather than a raise.
